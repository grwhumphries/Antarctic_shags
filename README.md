# Antarctic_shags
This repository is for the list of surveys from Antarctic shag breeding locations originally compiled in Schrimpf, Naveen, and Lynch. Population status of the Antarctic shag (*Phalacrocorax* [*atriceps*] *bransfieldensis*). In review at *Antarctic Science*.

**Note**: While the paper is in review, the database file is a placeholder, with only the first few lines from the database.


### Instructions
Surveys can be added by adding rows to the database.csv file. Please check the list first to ensure that any entries from colonies already in the database have matching names.

When entering a new data source, add the full citation to the bottom of this README.

**Note**: since this is a csv file, please refrain from using commas in the comments field.


### Column Headers

Lat: latitude (decimal degrees; WGS1983)
Lon: longitude (decimal degrees; WGS1983)
Region:
	1=Antarctic Peninsula/South Shetland Islands
	0=South Orkney Islands
Trend_code:
	0=most recent count, used in population total
	1=historical (<1995/96 when current count is >=2005/06), used in dacadal analysis
	2=trend (when >10 counts were available), displayed in Figure 2B-K
Count_Date: date of count
Count_Season: season of count (the year that season started, i.e. 1995 represents 1995/96)
Count_Type:
	N=active nests or breeding pairs present
	A=adults present
	C=chicks present
Count: reported count
Data_Source: citation (see full list below)
Pop_Estimate: population estimate derived from the count. Chick counts were divided by 1.7; adult counts were divided by 1.5. Any calculations rounded to the nearest integer.
